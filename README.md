# 🌌 Planet Distance Calculator - Frontend

Welcome to the **Planet Distance Calculator** frontend repository! This project is the user-facing interface of an application that calculates the distance between two celestial bodies on a specific date. Built using **Angular**, this web app offers a simple interface to calculate the distances between planets in our solar system.

This repository contains the source code for the frontend application. The backend consists of a java application build with spring boot, that offers an API to do the calculation on the server. It is hosted in a separate repository: Planet Distance API (https://github.com/MichaSchrader/planetdistance-api).
